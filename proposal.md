# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Hand Jam"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A videogame full of sequential minigames that are presented in collections of 5 different minigames. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be a Unity game that opens to a main menu with a world selection screen. The game will have at least one world with 5 minigames in it. All of the minigames will be very simple in both concept and controls. The first level of the first world will be an apple-catching game, then a game where you jump to avoid stampeding livestock, then a timed slicing game where you slice fish jumping out of a waterfall, then crossing a rickety bridge in rhythm, and then a boss fight with a looming volcano. Each level will be previewed from the last by moving from the foreground to the background layer in between levels. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- 1 world with passable pixel art, 5 functioning mini games, and a main menu

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Data persistence to save which levels have been completed and perfected, rewards for completing a level without mistakes

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Multiple unique worlds with more minigame styles

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

- We need to learn how to implement sprite sheets in Unity to get the characters animated at the right times. 
- We need to research scene transitions to smoothly move between minigames in a flashy way
- We need to learn how to implement sound effects and music, especially because the games ideally will be paced with the music
