be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Most of the sprite sheets are created and art has been made, 3 of the 5 levels have been coded, sprites just need to be added to the assetts
and things need to be debugged and polished. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Two levels left to create, music to write, and sprites to add to the game, the timing needs to be adjusted, so that the music semi lines up
with some aspects of the gameplay to make the game have more of a rhythm component and fun asthetic and fun to play. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Had to scope down the scale of the project in terms of coding and in creating art and music, we changed the art style and the concepts of multiple levels
multiple times while we were in the process of making the game.
